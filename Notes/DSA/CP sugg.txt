Firstly, ensure you have a strong grasp of one programming language, including its basics up to the usage of data structures like Stacks, Vectors, Sets, Queues, Strings, and Maps, along with their operations.

Next, choose a platform, either Codeforces or CodeChef. Set a goal to reach specialist in Codeforces and above or 3-star in CodeChef and above. Participate in contests regularly until you achieve this goal.

Once you've accomplished the above steps, you'll have proficiency in competitive programming up to a medium level. Now, transition to platforms like LeetCode and GeeksforGeeks for problem-solving. Aim to reach Knight level in LeetCode and higher.

Here are some recommended resources:

For DSA: Utilize the "Take U Forward" YouTube channel and their accompanying problem sheet.
For CP: Refer to the CSES problem sheet for practice and learning.
With consistent practice and dedication, you'll steadily improve your competitive programming skills.

How to approach the problem and how much time should be given ?

- Just 30 min for thinking . Atleast try to implement bruteforce approach first then think for optimization or any basic idea try to implement it . You'll get the wrong answer right . then dry run on the test case and understand why the solution is going wrong . then build on top of that . Like that you should approach the problem.
